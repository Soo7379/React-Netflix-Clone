Build a Netflix Clone web application with React.js.

This project has multiple pages: Home, Browse (which uses Firebase authentication), sign in, and sign up. The sign in page will connect to Firebase when a user tries to sign in, and when a user signs up, we will use Firebase auth to store the user in the Firebase auth database. Browse page will fetch series and films from movie API.
